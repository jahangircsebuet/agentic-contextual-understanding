        "text": "BNP shifted its initial post-July demand of early election to facilitate the so-called elitist idea of 'reform' by an unelected body, and then consistently became engaged in absolutely unnecessary meetings of 'Jatyio Oikomotto Komishon'. They were trying to please the urban people so that they believe BNP is not an anti-reform party. Tarek Zia came to BD just before the election and now he seems busy meeting with urban elite people all the time. Journalists, businessmen, diplomats are behaving in such a manner that he is already in power and the country has got its next prime minister even before the election. Such elite-urban pleasing mentality of BNP would hurt them in the election, if they can't connect to the rural people before Feb 12. \
            Jamaat is a very cunning political force. They have used NCP's leaders and workers to make the urban elite believe that a document such as 'July charter' can save the country from future Hasinas. BNP leaders miserably fell into this  trap designed by Jamaat-NCP and orchestrated by the interim. In the meantime, Jamaat have prepared their election candidates. The stunning move regarding NCP break up shows how ruthless Jamaat can become in achieving its political goals. So many good promising young elites spend so much time and energy in making and popularising NCP. Now they all are forced to leave the party and say goodbye to their political ambition. Jamaat has been playing with them from the very beginning with the poster boy Nahid islam. That guy is just another Jamaat agent, as it seems.  \
            I think, if BNP leaders are dumb enough to fall for Jamaat's political traps, they should not run the country as well. If Jamaat is truly that good, that they can essentially maneuver the July sentiment to gain their political aims, they are actually the deserving winner of the upcoming election. They will even do good in the international diplomatic arena as well.",

            Young girls and women across Bangladesh deserve to feel empowered and supported by those around them. Every woman must enjoy the same dignity, security, and opportunity as any man. \
            On this International Women’s Day, I reaffirm that, just like the previous BNP governments led by Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman and Begum Khaleda Zia, we should all work tirelessly to create a just, tolerant, and respectful society that doesn’t discriminate based on gender, race, or religion. Our daughters should have equal opportunities as our sons, and they should step outside their homes or use the internet without harassment, and take up space to use their voices without fear. \
            BNP’s policy formulation is deeply rooted in recognising the untapped potential of women in a safe and secure society, with initiatives like our “family card” programme, SME loans for women entrepreneurs, academic and vocational schemes to educate young girls. Together, let’s continue to champion women’s economic empowerment, political participation, and personal aspirations.",
